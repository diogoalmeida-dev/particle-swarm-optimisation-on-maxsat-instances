# metaheuristics-analysis-on-maxsat-istances
 Implemented and tested two metaheuristics for solving MAX-SAT instances, with one requiring a multi-state design. Each algorithm must are evaluated on the provided DIMACS instances and do 30 independent runs with different random seeds to assess performance and parameter sensitivity.
